Pacman Simple Game
=================

About
This project is a simplified Pacman-style game designed as a practical tool for learning software testing. It provides hands-on experience with key development tools such as Git, Maven, JUnit, and Mockito.

Parts of the codebase are already tested, while others are intentionally left untested to encourage test writing and the practice of test-driven development (TDD). The framework serves as a solid foundation for building, extending, and testing Java applications in a structured way.
